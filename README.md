literature review for Forecast Based Financing for flooding (August 2021)

I wrote this Literature Review of Forecast Based Financing for extreme flooding for my technical writing course during the Summer of 2021. I chose to do a literature review on this topic because at the time I was working in the BYU Hydroinformatics lab, building a web app to visualize flood inundation extents and impact data. I am posting this on Github to serve as an example of my writing.
